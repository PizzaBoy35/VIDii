        <h1>Eeveelution guide</h1>
        
        <p>Since 1996, Pokémon has taken over the world and spawned an incredicle amount of games, shows, merchandise and more. Catching new Pokémon, fighting/trading them with others and going on an adventure together is the exact appeal of this giant franchise, all starting at the original Pokémon Red and Blue games for the Nintendo Gameboy. One of the most popular Pokémon to explain the ways of evolution is Eevee, the 2nd mascot after Pikachu. </p>
            
        <p>But Eevee's evolutions can be quite complicated when compared to the rest. That is because Eevee has 8 potential different evolutions, all with different types and stats. That is what this interface is all about. Start by navigating to the right or use the shortcut menu in the upper left corner to find out about all so-called Eeveelutions and the ways that you can get them in the games.</p>
